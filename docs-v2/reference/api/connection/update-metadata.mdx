## Update _connection metadata_

Nango uses the request body as the new metadata (it must be a JSON object). Note that this overrides specified properties, not the entire metadata.

You can either pass the `connection_id` or the `connection_token` in the body to update the metadata. Both can be either a single `string` or an `array` of strings.

## Fetching _connection metadata_

To read the existing metadata of a _connection_, simply fetch the connection. Your custom metadata is included as part of the returned connection object.
